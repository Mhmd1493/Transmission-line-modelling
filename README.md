Program Model and Project Report:
- Exploring ideas to develop a software program for a case-study in power systems, which is selected by students in light of the educational material presented within the course.
- The program could be used to:
a) calculate the transmission line parameters and constants for various transmission line designs,
b) design and calculate the performance of a transmission line,
c) design one of the techniques used for the purpose of reactive power/voltage control, ...etc.
Identifying the main objective/s of the program model, which should address a topic or more of these discussed throughout the course.
